/**
 * THE DIFFERENTIATOR LIVES HERE.
 *
 * The statechart compiles to database objects: a transition table holding the
 * legal edges as DATA, and a trigger that rejects any history row whose
 * (from,to) pair is absent from that table.
 *
 * Why this matters: enforcement in a service layer protects only the code paths
 * that go through the service layer. A bulk import, an admin script, a data-fix
 * migration or a second service will eventually write directly - and on that
 * day an application silently reaches a state the process says is impossible.
 * Here the guarantee is a property of the data store, so the bypass simply
 * fails.
 *
 * The reference target is PostgreSQL; this implementation uses the embedded
 * SQLite in `node:sqlite` so the guarantee is executable with no install.
